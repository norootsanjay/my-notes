## Authentication and Authorization Flow

When a command like creating a pod is issued, the following steps occur:

1. **Authentication:**  
    The API server authenticates the request. For example, when you run a command via kubectl, the KubeConfig file provides the necessary certificates. Consider the following configuration:

> cat ~/.kube/config    
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
  certificate-authority-data: LS0tCIlRjdG......BQyMjAwFURs9tCg==
  server: https://example.com
  name: example-cluster
```
    
2. **Authorization (RBAC):**  
    Once authenticated, the API server checks if the user is authorized to perform the requested action. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is commonly used here. For instance, if a user is assigned the following role:
    
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list", "get", "create", "update", "delete"]
```
    
The user is permitted to list, get, create, update, or delete pods. RBAC can also restrict access to specific resource names or namespaces:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: developer
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["create"]
      resourceNames: ["blue", "orange"]
```
These RBAC rules are enforced at the API level and determine which API operations a user can access.
# The Role of Admission Controllers

While RBAC handles basic authorization, it does not offer advanced validations or mutations. Admission controllers step in to provide additional security by:

- Validating pod specifications (e.g., ensuring that images are not from a public Docker Hub registry or enforcing the prohibition of the "latest" tag).
- Rejecting pods running containers as the root user, or enforcing specific Linux capabilities.
- Ensuring required metadata like labels is included.

Admission controllers can validate requests, modify configurations, or perform extra operations before the resources are persisted to etcd.

## Built-In Admission Controllers

Some of the built-in admission controllers in Kubernetes include:

- **AlwaysPullImages:** Forces image pulling on each pod creation.
- **DefaultStorageClass:** Automatically assigns a default storage class to PVCs if none is specified.
- **EventRateLimit:** Limits the number of concurrent API server requests to prevent overload.
- **NamespaceExists:** Rejects requests to operate in non-existent namespaces.

# Detailed Example: Namespace Existence Check

Consider attempting to create a pod in a non-existent namespace named "blue." When you execute:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image nginx --namespace blue
```

The request proceeds through authentication and authorization, then reaches the admission controllers. The NamespaceExists admission controller checks for the "blue" namespace and rejects the request if it does not exist:

```
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "blue" not found
```

Alternatively, Kubernetes offers the NamespaceAutoProvision admission controller (not enabled by default) to automatically create a missing namespace.

To check the enabled admission controllers, run:

```
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
```

This command lists the active admission plugins, including defaults such as NamespaceLifecycle, LimitRanger, and ServiceAccount, among others.

# Configuring Admission Controllers

## Enabling Admission Controllers

To add a new admission controller, update the `enable-admission-plugins` flag on the Kube API server service. For a kubeadm-based setup, modify the kube-apiserver manifest file.

### Traditional Kube API Server Service

```
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver \
    --advertise-address=${INTERNAL_IP} \
    --allow-privileged=true \
    --apiserver-count=3 \
    --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC \
    --bind-address=0.0.0.0 \
    --enable-swagger-ui=true \
    --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
    --event-ttl=1h \
    --runtime-config=api/all \
    --service-cluster-ip-range=10.32.0.0/24 \
    --service-node-port-range=30000-32767 \
    --v=2 \
    --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,NamespaceAutoProvision
```

### Kubeadm-Based Setup (API Server as a Pod)

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: kube-apiserver
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
    - --advertise-address=172.17.0.107
    - --allow-privileged=true
    - --enable-bootstrap-token-auth=true
    - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,NamespaceAutoProvision
    image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver-amd64:v1.11.3
    name: kube-apiserver
```

*Disabling Admission Controllers*:
To disable specific admission controllers, use the `disable-admission-plugins` flag in a similar manner.

# Auto-Provisioning a Namespace

Once the admission controller is correctly configured, executing the pod creation command in a previously non-existent namespace "blue" will trigger the NamespaceAutoProvision controller, which will automatically create the namespace and allow the pod creation to succeed. For example:

```
kubectl run nginx --image nginx --namespace blue
Pod/nginx created!
```

Listing the namespaces confirms the creation of "blue":

```
kubectl get namespaces
NAME         STATUS   AGE
blue         Active   3m
default      Active   23m
kube-public  Active   24m
kube-system  Active   24m
```

# Transition from Deprecated Controllers

It is important to note that the NamespaceAutoProvision and NamespaceExists admission controllers have been deprecated. They have been replaced by the NamespaceLifecycle admission controller, which:

- Rejects requests to non-existent namespaces.
- Protects default namespaces (default, kube-system, kube-public) from deletion.

This ensures a robust and consistent namespace management mechanism.

| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
