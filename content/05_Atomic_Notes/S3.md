S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a *highly scalable, available, secure, and high-performance object storage service* provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Despite its name including three S, it is primarily recognized as S3, a robust solution for storing and managing your data in the cloud.
![[Pasted image 20250808005250.png]]
It works with services like:
1. EC2
2. Lambda
3. IAM
- [n] This integration allows you to control access via robust IAM policies and roles.
- [3] Additionally, S3 can be managed through various interfaces, including the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, or REST APIâ€”providing versatility regardless of your preferred method of interaction.

- It is an object-based storage system that stores complete objects (files) with their metadata.
- S3 employs a flat namespace.
- The folder-like view in the AWS console is simply a visual convenience created by using prefixes in object names.

## Common Use Cases
1. Application log files.
2. Media assets.
3. Artifacts generated from CI/CD pipelines.

- [n] S3's versatility makes it suitable for a broad range of deployment architectures beyond the typical use cases mentioned above.

## S3 in a Web application deployment
_Consider a traditional web application hosting scenario where a web server stores HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files. For media-intensive sites such as YouTube or Netflix, storing all assets on the same server can become inefficient and costly._

**A common deployment strategy with S3 involves:**
1. Hosting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on the web server.
2. Storing media files (videos, images, audio) in an S3 bucket.
3. Embedding URLs in the HTML that point directly to media stored in S3.
4. Offloading media requests to S3, which ensures efficient, scalable, and cost-effective delivery of large data volumes.

## Key Terminologies and Concepts
### Bucket
Buckets are the containers in S3 where objects (files) are stored. Think of a bucket as a folder that groups related files. You can create multiple buckets to organize data by application, use case, or data type (e.g., one for logs and another for media).
### Objects
An object in S3 consists of the file data and its metadata. Each object includes:
- A key: a unique name for the file.
- A value: the actual data of the file.
- Additional properties such as version ID and metadata (if versioning is enabled).
### Flat File Structure
There is no inherent concept of nested directories. While the AWS console may visually display folder-like groupings using prefixes, the underlying storage remains flat. For example, uploading files with keys like "music/song_one", "music/song_two", and "music/song_three" creates the illusion of a "music" folder.
### Data Durability and Availability
When you upload a file to S3, AWS replicates it across multiple servers and availability zones. This replication ensures high durability and availability, protecting your data even if a server or entire availability zone fails.
### Unique bucket names
Each S3 bucket must have a globally unique name across all AWS accounts. This name is part of the bucket's URL. If the chosen name is already in use, you must select a different one
## S3 Restrictions
When using S3, keep the following restrictions in mind:
- S3 can store an _unlimited number of objects._
- The maximum size for a single object is _5 terabytes._
- By default, each AWS account can create up to _100 buckets_. This limit can be increased up to _1,000 by requesting a service limit increase_.
