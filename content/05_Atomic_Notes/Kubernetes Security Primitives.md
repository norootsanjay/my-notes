# Securing Cluster Hosts

The security of your Kubernetes cluster begins with the hosts themselves. Protect your underlying infrastructure by following these practices:

- Disable root access.
- Turn off password-based authentication.
- Enforce SSH key-based authentication.
- Implement additional measures to secure your physical or virtual systems.

A compromised host can expose your entire cluster, so securing these systems is a critical first step.

# API Server Access Control

The Kube API server is at the heart of Kubernetes operations because all cluster interactions—whether via the kubectl command-line tool or directly through API calls—pass through it. Effective access control is essential, focusing on two key questions:

1. Who can access the cluster?
2. What actions are they permitted to perform?

## Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service before granting access to the API server. Kubernetes offers various authentication mechanisms to suit different security needs:

- Static user IDs and passwords
- Tokens
- Client certificates
- Integration with external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP)

Additionally, service accounts support non-human processes. Detailed guidance on these methods is available in dedicated sections of our documentation.

![The image outlines authentication methods, including usernames, passwords, tokens, certificates, LDAP, and service accounts, under the question "Who can access?"](https://kodekloud.com/kk-media/image/upload/v1752869939/notes-assets/images/CKA-Certification-Course-Certified-Kubernetes-Administrator-Kubernetes-Security-Primitives/frame_120.jpg)

## Authorization

After authentication, authorization determines what actions a user or service is allowed to perform. The default mechanism, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), associates identities with specific permissions. Kubernetes also supports:

- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Node Authorization
- Webhook-based authorization

These mechanisms enforce granular access control policies, ensuring that authenticated entities can perform only the operations they are permitted to execute.

![The image lists types of authorization: RBAC, ABAC, Node Authorization, and Webhook Mode, under the heading "Authorization: What can they do?"](https://kodekloud.com/kk-media/image/upload/v1752869939/notes-assets/images/CKA-Certification-Course-Certified-Kubernetes-Administrator-Kubernetes-Security-Primitives/frame_140.jpg)

# Securing Component Communications

Secure communications between Kubernetes components are enabled via TLS encryption. This ensures that data transmitted between key components remains confidential and tamper-proof. Encryption protects:

- Communication within the etcd cluster
- Interactions between the Kube Controller Manager and Kube Scheduler
- Links between worker node components such as the Kubelet and Kube Proxy

For more detailed instructions on setting up and managing TLS certificates, refer to our comprehensive certificate management guides.

# Network Policies

By default, pods in a Kubernetes cluster communicate freely with one another. To restrict unwanted interactions and enhance security, Kubernetes provides network policies. These policies allow you to:

- Control traffic flow between specific pods
- Enforce security rules at the network level

For an in-depth discussion on implementing network policies with practical examples, please see the related documentation.

For a secure Kubernetes environment, consider combining these security primitives with additional best practices and tools to counter evolving threats.
