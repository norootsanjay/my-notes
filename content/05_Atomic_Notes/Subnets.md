*Groups of IP addresses within your VPC, allowing you to deploy resources into isolated segments*
When you launch an AWS resource—such as an EC2 instance—it must be assigned to a specific subnet.
# Availability Zones and Subnet Placement

Every subnet is associated with a single availability zone. For instance, if you have:

- **Subnet One** in Availability Zone 1; any resource deployed within this subnet will reside in that zone.
- **Subnet Two** in Availability Zone 2; resources will similarly be placed in the second zone.

By selecting the appropriate subnet for your resource deployment, you are effectively choosing the availability zone where your resource will reside.

# Public vs. Private Subnets

Subnets can be designated as either public or private based on the intended use:

- **Public Subnets:**  
    Ideal for resources that need direct internet connectivity, such as web servers or public applications. Public subnets have a direct route to an Internet Gateway.
    
- **Private Subnets:**  
    Best suited for resources that do not require exposure to the internet, such as databases or internal applications. Internet-bound traffic in private subnets typically routes via a NAT Gateway.
    

# CIDR Range and Subnet Configuration

A key aspect of subnet configuration is the CIDR range. For example, if your VPC is assigned a CIDR of 192.168.0.0/16, every subnet you create must have an IP address range within this block. Examples include:

- A subnet defined as 192.168.10.0/24 is valid.
- A subnet defined as 10.100.1.0/24 is outside the VPC's CIDR range and would trigger a configuration error.

Further, the block size of any subnet must be between /16 and /28. Note the following reserved IP address rules within each subnet:

Reserved IP Addresses

- The first four IP addresses in every subnet are reserved:
    - The **first address** serves as the network address.
    - The **second address** is typically used by the VPC router.
    - The **third address** is reserved for DNS.
    - The **fourth address** is held for future use.
- Additionally, the **last IP address** in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.10.255 in a /24 subnet) is reserved as the broadcast address.

# Avoiding Overlapping Subnets

When creating subnets within the same VPC, ensure their IP address ranges do not overlap. For example:

- Subnet A: 10.16.0.0/24
- Subnet B: 10.16.0.128/25

This configuration is invalid because the ranges overlap. However, overlapping subnets in different VPCs are permitted.

# IPv6 Support and Internal Routing

Subnets can also be assigned an IPv6 CIDR block (commonly a /56) or even be configured to use exclusively IPv6 addresses. By default, resources in subnets can communicate with one another within the same VPC without requiring additional routing configurations in route tables.

# Auto-Assigning Public IP Addresses

When configuring a subnet, you can enable the option to auto-assign a public IPv4 or IPv6 address to a resource upon deployment. Typically, instances receive a private IP address by default. Enabling this feature is particularly useful for resources in public subnets that require internet connectivity. When this setting is enabled:

- A public IP address is automatically assigned alongside the private IP.
- This ensures that resources, such as internet-facing web servers, are reachable by external users.
